# Best practices
 
#### When you find yourself writing nearly repeated code, try to abstract instead.

#### DRY (donâ€™t repeat yourself)

#### Strategy design pattern which lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm (called a strategy), and select an algorithm at run time

#### Behavior parameterization: The ability to tell a method to take multiple behaviors (or strategies) as parameters and use them inter-nally to accomplish different behaviors.

#### You need abstract over behavior and make your code adapt to require-ment changes
